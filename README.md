This app helps track the Foods you eat and calories you consume. It also allows you to add a food to a specific meal (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or Snack) in order to view the food your eating better at a glance. It tracks calories for each meal as well as calories for all foods tracked.

You can search for a food item (food or drink), using the search box that appears under the words- look up food here:

To add a food item to the tracked foods list click on it from the search results list.
If you consumed more then one of a certain item you should click on it more then once to track two or more of it.

Once an item is on the Foods Tracked list you can assign it to a meal. Your foods will appear in both the meals and the Foods Tracked lists.

You can run the app at the following link: http://renniesb.github.io/food_guide/index.html
